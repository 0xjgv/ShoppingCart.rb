# ShoppingCart.rb
The ShoppingCart should help us calculate the price of various items we add to it.

+ By default, items will have no discount.
+ If an item has a discount, it should be calculated by calling a discount method on that item.
+ Fruits have no discount during weekdays but on weekends they have a 10% discount.
+ Housewares have no discount unless their unit price is more than 100€ / $100. In that case they have a 5% discount.
+ When a customer has more than 5 items in their cart, they get a 10% discount for that purchase.
+ Create a shop that sells the following items

Bananas: 10€ / $10 each
Orange Juice: 10€ / $10 each
Rice: 1€ / $1 per unit
Vacuum Cleaner: 150€ / $150
Anchovies: 2€ / $2 each
